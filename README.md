# Monky - a sample game implementation for Garmin ConnectIQ SDK

Monky is the tiny monster living on your wrist, depending on you and your lifestyle for its well-being.
It comes with four attributes that you control through various actions, either in-game or real life:
- healthy
- happy
- clean
- fit

Since Monky is a living thing, it builds up experience (xp) from each of its daily activities.
However, this also means it gets tired, hungry and dirty as the day progresses. So it might need a cookie and a scrub once in a while.
Being tied to you, Monky will be as fit as you are, by the way. If you find Monky to be out of shape, you probably haven't moved that much.

## Supported devices:
- Garmin vivoactive 3
- Garmin vivoactive 3 Music

I've only physically tested the vivoactive 4S since it is the only one I own, so please feel free to open an issue if you have problems with any of the above.

# Disclaimer
This software is free, intended for educational and entertainment purposes and hopefully fun.
I wanted to get into developing software for my Garmin vivoactive4S, mainly for personal use, and what better way than a small nostalgic game?
Hope this reaches and helps the right people.

Yes, "Monky" is inspired by Monkey C, the language used to write the game.

Really looking forward to feedback and feature requests!
